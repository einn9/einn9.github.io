        <p>From Bruce Lee in a 1971 interview on The Pierre Berton Show.</p>
        <p>Here we have the very iconic quote from the great martial artist and philosopher Bruce Lee. This quote means so much to me. To be water is to be able to adapt to any circumstance. Let your emotions speak to you, be angry if necessary, but find peace when peace finds you as well. Don’t push yourself beyond what you can handle, but don’t resist the natural flow either. You need to reach a state of balance that allows you to lean left or right when the moment calls for it. To me, that's what he means with this quote. Being like water is learning to listen to move fluidly through the paths that speak within you.</p>
