        <p>From Bruce Lee in a 1971 interview on *The Pierre Berton Show*.</p>
        <p>This iconic quote from the legendary martial artist and philosopher Bruce Lee holds deep meaning for me. To be water is to be able to adapt to any situation. Let your emotions speak to you, feel anger if needed, but also find peace when it finds you. Don't push yourself beyond your limits, but also don’t resist the natural flow. Achieving balance allows you to shift your focus when necessary. This is what Bruce Lee implies with this quote—being like water is learning to listen and move fluidly along the paths within you.</p>
