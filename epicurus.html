        <p>From *Discourses and Selected Writings* by Epictetus.</p>
        <p>This quote from the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus speaks about how we allow the value of external things to dominate our souls. As human beings, we already naturally flow like water, with everything we need to be happy at our disposal. The issue is that society places too much value on things outside ourselves, often without questioning why we value them. Many of us chase after an endless pursuit of things that donâ€™t resonate with the emotions inside. Epictetus suggests that even today, we can set ourselves free and reconnect with our true selves. Though it may be obscured by daily, greedy thoughts, our inner nature remains unchanged and ready to flow like water.</p>
