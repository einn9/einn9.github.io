        <p>From Discourses and Selected Writings by Epictetus.</p>
        <p>A more recent find, this quote from the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus speaks about how much we let the value of externals take over our soul. The truth is that, as human beings, we already naturally flow like water. We have everything at our disposal to be the happiest we could ever be. The problem is that, as a society, we have chosen to place too much value on things outside our soul, so much so that we don't even stop to consider why we value them. Most of us are just chasing an endless path to things that don't actually resonate the emotions bottled up inside. And what Epictetus means is just that: even today, you can set yourself free, and finally connect with your inner self, because it is still the same as it once was, it may seem covered up by greedy, daily thoughts, but it has always been ready to flow like water.</p>
