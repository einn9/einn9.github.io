        <p>From *Vagabond* by Takehiko Inoue Chapter 305.</p>
        <p>This quote is from the manga *Vagabond* created by Takehiko Inoue. The story follows a master swordsman who reaches the pinnacle of greatness in Japan, only to realize there is nothing waiting for him at the top. The latter part of the story sees him reflecting on his journey and questioning what life truly means. This quote resonates with me because it highlights the simplicity of water, and how it is its own master because it chooses to be. Water flows with the current, without need or resistance. To me, this represents the act of simply existing in the universe, accepting that as the essence of who you are. True freedom lies in that flow.</p>
