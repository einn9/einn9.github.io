        <p>From Vagabond by Takehiko Inoue Chapter 305.</p>
        <p>This quote is from the manga Vagabond made by Takehiko Inoue. The manga follows a master swordsman who became the greatest in Japan, only to realize there is nothing waiting for him at the top. He spends the latter half of the story thinking back on his journey and what life even means to him. To me, this quote is incredible because it speaks to the simplicity of water, and how it is its only master â€” precisely because it chooses to be so. The flow of water simply is, moving with the current without needing anything else. I believe this is what flowing is, the act to just exist within the universe, and accept that as the essence of what you are. That is where freedom is found.</p>
